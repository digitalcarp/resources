### Notes

Computer output is to DAC/amp stack for headphones and 2i2 for speakers.

Turntable uses an RCA-to-line cable as input into 2i2. Mic XLR also connected
to 2i2. Due to lack of inputs, connecting the turntable and mic is mutually
exclusive. It's a bit scuffed, but good enough for my use case and mixes
turn table and computer sound well.

## Software

The following software is used to record microphone inputs for voice chats and
meetings.

* [OBS](https://obsproject.com/)
* [ReaPlugs VST FX Suite](https://www.reaper.fm/reaplugs/)

### Steps

2. Apply ReaPlugs filters to microphone input
3. Select VB-CABLE as input source in voice chat software
